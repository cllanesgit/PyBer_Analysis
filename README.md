# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
In the this data analysis, we show the statistical differences between the three city types provided: rural, suburban, and urban. The data clearly shows us that there is a significant cost difference between the fare per driver/ride and total fare between these city types. Usually, the higher the price, the less total rides and total drivers involved. At the same time, this is due to the higher demand in the more populated areas. In our graph, we provide data from Jan 1, 2019, to Apr 4, 2019.

## Results
Here are some of the results provided by the data to show the before-mentioned claims:

### Rural:
* Total Rides: 125
* Total Drivers: 78
* Total Fares: $4,327.93
* Average Fare Per Ride: $34.62
* Average Fare Per Driver: $55.49

### Suburban:
* Total Rides: 625
* Total Drivers: 490
* Total Fares: $19,356.33
* Average Fare Per Ride: $30.97
* Average Fare Per Driver: $39.50

### Urban:
* Total Rides: 1625
* Total Drivers: 2405
* Total Fares: $39,854.38
* Average Fare Per Ride: $24.53
* Average Fare Per Driver: $16.57

## Summary
There are great disparities in this data that need to be addressed and resolved if possible. One possible way of doing this is to charge riders a higher rate on urban areas as they will most likely traverse shorter distances and will make up for the discrepancies in the fares of the other city types. Another thing that could be kept in mind is demand and providing the proper amount of personel to meet it. Finally, it could be attempted to increase rates for rural as well since not a lot of income comes from this type of city.
